How To Use This Repo
--------------------

This is the repository where you'll submit your homework.    
Follow these directions closely to switch over to this repository.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your ```~/code``` folder.
3. Create a directory in the ```sf-wdi-51-homework``` folder using your real name and github account name. Example: ```sf-wdi-51-homework/nicole-Borgaard```. That will make it easier for us to remember everyone's GitHub username. :)
4. For each homework make sure to put your files in a new `week_x` directory in your named directory. Example for homework in week 2: `sf-wdi-51-homework/nicole-Borgaard/week_2/slackBot/hubot.js`

Example of how your local homework directory should be structured:


    |-- code/
        |-- sf-wdi-51-resources/ (cloned from Github)
        |-- sf-wdi-51-homework/ (cloned from Github)
            |-- firstName-githubUsername/
                |-- week_1/
                    |-- bottleApp/
                        |-- bottlesOfBeer.js
                        |-- index.html
                    |-- spontaneousTravelApp/
                        |-- randomAddressGenerator.js
                |-- week_2/
                    |-- hubot/
                        |-- hubot.js
                |-- week_3/
                |-- week_4/
                |-- week_5/
